# Keyboard input, elaborated

Let's rewrite our keyboard example one more time, and make it into something
more polished.

We'll introduce limits on polyphony, craft a lusher-sounding instrumental
voice, add some effects and compression, and restructure our logic so it
starts to approach what a real musical application might look like.

Invoke with:

```
supriya$ python -m examples.keyboard_input_elaborated --help
```

... to see complete options.

See the example documentation for a complete explanation.

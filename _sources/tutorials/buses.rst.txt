Buses
=====

..  self-criticism::

    These docs are still under construction.

- what is a bus?
- buses vs bus groups
- calculation rates

Lifecycle
---------

Buses can only be added to running servers, so letâ€™s create one and boot it:

    >>> server = supriya.Server().boot()

..  note::

    :py:class:`Scores <supriya.contexts.nonrealtime.Score>` are neither online
    nor offline, so you can add buses to them whenever you like.

Creation
````````

- what is allocation? leasing, block allocation

Allocate a bus with::

    >>> bus = server.add_bus()

Allocate a bus group of 8 buses with::

    >>> bus_group = server.add_bus_group(count=8)

Deletion
````````

Free a bus with::

    >>> bus.free()

Free a bus group with::

    >>> bus_group.free()

Configuration
-------------

The number of buses available in a context is controlled by its
:py:class:`options <supriya.scsynth.Options>`.

- Set the maximum number of control buses with the
  ``control_bus_channel_count`` keyword.

- Set the maximum number of audio buses with the ``control_bus_channel_count``
  keyword.

- Set the number of *input* audio buses to the server with the
  ``input_bus_channel_count`` keyword.

- Set the number of *output* audio buses to the server with the
  ``output_bus_channel_count`` keyword.

..  note::

    The ``input_bus_channel_count`` and ``output_bus_channel_count`` values are
    independent of what your current soundcard supports. They can be greater
    than or less than the number of available channels, but won't actually
    carry more information if you select a higher value internal to the
    context. Typically you select the same or fewer channels.

These can be set on an :py:class:`~supriya.scsynth.Options` instance passed the
context when initialized or booting, or just as keyword arguments.

Examples overview
=================

..  info::

    All examples are located under the :si-icon:`octicons/mark-github-16` :github-tree:`examples/` subdirectory
    inside the repository.

Unless specified otherwise in the example's ``README.md`` (or in the example's
documentation here) you can run the example like a script:

..  shell::
    :cwd: ../examples/hello_world
    :rel: ..
    :user: josephine
    :host: laptop

    python hello_world.py

Examples can be explored in any order, but - in general - they progress from
simple subjects to more complex ones in the order they appear in the
documentation here.
